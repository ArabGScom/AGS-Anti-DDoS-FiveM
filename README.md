The AGS Team will replace your IP address with the IP address of the Safe AGS Network.
For Example:
USERS < ==== > AGS Safe Server < ==== > Your Server


# Setup For FiveM - open your server.cfg and add this
# replace xx.xx.xx.xx TO Your  IP from AGS Anti DDoS
endpoint_add_tcp "0.0.0.0:30120"
endpoint_add_udp "0.0.0.0:30120"
sv_listingIPOverride "xx.xx.xx.xx"
